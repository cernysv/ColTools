# Permission Details

This document outlines the process for obtaining additional permissions for the use of the **ColTools** library and/or its source code beyond the terms set forth in the license agreement.

## Process of Evaluation
I review every request individually. While I strive to respond promptly, there may occasionally be a delay. This delay should not exceed one week. If it does, please check the recipient email address and consider submitting a second request.

To facilitate tracking, please ensure that your email subject starts with **"ColTools - "** so that I can find it easily. Requests that do not follow this format may be overlooked.

- **Date and time of request**

- **A detailed description of how you intend to use the library or source code**
- **The specific permissions you are seeking** (e.g., commercial use, sublicensing)
